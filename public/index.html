        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in learning
            and
            playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of soccer,
            specifically those
            skills around team cooperation and good sportsmanship.</p>

        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes through
            the
            building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>

        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's
            northside
            neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
            between the
            ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small full-time staff,
            and relies
            on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>

        <h1>Northside Youth Soccer League</h1>
        <h2>Rules of Play &amp; Policies</h2>
        <p>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>

        <h2>Sportsmanship</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals
                of
                sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
                whose behavior
                detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer
                background,
                expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fifa Field Regulations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Dimensions.</h3> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given
                maximum and
                minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under
                12 and older.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Competition Fields.</h3> Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x
                60 yards.
                Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to
                provide a
                field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                assign its Fields
                Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                dimensions
                should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                acceptable field
                may be required to play all their games away.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Fields Used By Young Age Groups.</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age
                        groups should
                        be progressively larger.</li>
                    <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                    <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                    <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions and size of
                        goal similarly
                        modified.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Team Bench Areas</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Recreation &amp; District Programs
                        <ul>
                            <li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will be made by the governing
                                body of that
                                team. A team's bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard away from
                                the touchline and
                                extending to twenty yards (20) both ways from the halfway line. In the event that
                                field 2 conditions
                                require team benches to be on the same side of the field, a team's bench area shall
                                consist of that area
                                two(2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty yards one (1) way from the
                                halfway line.</li>
                            <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to locate its bench area.
                                Coaches and substitutes
                                are required to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents and
                                spectators should occupy the
                                same side of the field as the team they are supporting.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>State Competition League Only
                        <ul>
                            <li>Except where it is determined by the referee to be impractical, team bench areas
                                shall be along the
                                same touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards outside the
                                touchline, beginning not
                                closer than five yards from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                                from midfield. The home
                                team shall have the right to choose the location of its bench area. Coaches and
                                substitutes must remain
                                within their team's bench area during the game.</li>
                            <li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite the team bench areas.
                                Supporters of a team
                                must assemble on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that team.
                                There shall be a
                                buffer zone extending ten yards on each side of the midfield that may not be
                                occupied by parents or
                                spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to enforce these provisions and may
                                suspend or terminate
                                games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or spectator declines to abide by
                                requests from match
                                officials to comply with these standards.</li>

                Soccer
                Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8 play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not
                sanction games
                involving teams under 10 or younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
                players per

                replaced may re-enter the game as a substitute at a later time.
                <ol>
                    <li>Prior to a throw-in your favor.</li>

                confiscated by
                the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was received. That player will
                be
                suspended from playing in the next game in which the offending participant would otherwise be
                eligible to
                participate. This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received during a
                playing year, the
                player will be suspended from playing in the next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card)
                for which the
                offending participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall deliver all
